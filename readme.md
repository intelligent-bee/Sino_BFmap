* This code should be run in a python environment.

## Analysis
* Please run "pip install -r requirements_analysis.txt" to install the dependencies before executing any python file.
* The analysis is divided into three main components:

| Component                                                         | Folder                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Accessibility                                                  | `access_process`               |
| Availability and Diversity                                     | `availability_diversity_process` |
| Residential Capacity Allocation and Infrastructure Occupation | `inequal_allocation_process`   |

To reproduce each component of the analysis, please refer to the `readme.md` file in the corresponding folder and follow the instructions.
