* This code should be run in a python environment.

## Analysis
* Please run "pip install -r requirements_analysis.txt" to install the dependencies before executing any Python file.
* The analysis is divided into three main components:
| Component                                                         | Folder                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1. Accessibility                                                  | `#access_process`               |
| 2. Availability and Diversity                                     | `#availability_diversity_process` |
| 3. Residential Capacity Allocation and Infrastructure Occupation | `#inequal_allocation_process`   |
* To reproduce the analysis for each component, please refer to the readme file in the corresponding folder and follow the instructions.
